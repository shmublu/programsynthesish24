This is an html page that creates boolean or integer SyGuS queries and transforms the solutions to those queries into valid JS code.
To use, run "npm start" or "node start". The server will be running, by default, at localhost on port 3000. Go to 127.0.0.1:3000 and follow the on screen prompts in the first two text boxes to enter the parameters to your query. If it is solvable by cvc5, then it will return the solution in javascript.

dependencies:
cvc5
node
